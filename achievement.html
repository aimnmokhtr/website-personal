Learning online was tough, but I used technologies to keep up. Balancing my studies during the pandemic took discipline and flexibility.

These experiences taught me that staying determined and with a positive attitude could help us succeed even when things are tough. Getting top grades in the SPM examination during Covid-19 reminded me that dedication, adaptability, and enjoying learning could help us overcome the big challenges.</font></font>

		<font face= "MV Boli" font size= "4">	
		<p><font color="green"> During my time in university, I followed a good study plan that went beyond regular classes. Late nights of studying, working on group projects with classmates, and asking professors for help were all important parts of how I learned. Balancing my classwork with other activities took careful planning, but the great feeling of making it onto the dean's list made it all worthwhile. This experience not only showed I was good at my studies but also highlighted how important it is to look at education in a well-rounded way. Having support from lectures, friends, and always wanting to improve all played a role in this achievement. Being recognized as the best student and making it onto the dean's list proves that working hard, staying dedicated, and loving to learn can make a big impact throughout the university journey.</font>

		<p><font color="green">Getting involved in sports at school, especially running, was a big deal for me. It helped me get in better shape and taught me important life skills. Running with my classmates not only made us better friends but also gave me a sense of accomplishment when we finished races. The support from coaches and teammates motivated me, and running became a great way to relieve stress from school. Besides making me physically healthier, it taught me to be disciplined, manage my time well, and work as a team. Looking back on those school sports days, I'm thankful for the lessons and the chance to grow both personally and physically.</font></font>

When I aimed my bow at the target, it taught me to concentrate and be disciplined, skills that helped me in other parts of my life. Archery wasn't just about shooting arrows; it taught me important life stuff too. I learned to be patient, stay focused, and handle pressure.
