	<p><b>⏰ 2016 - 2021</p></b>
	<p><b>📍 Sekolah Menengah Agama Rantau</p></b>
	<p> I faced new subjects and made close friends. Spread of COVID-19 changed my daily routine, and I had to join online classes. Even though it was hard, my friends and I helped each other with late-night study sessions on video calls. We became more close, facing uncertainties together. In 2020 also, we were supposed to take the SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia) examination, but due to the spread of COVID-19, the exam was delayed. The pandemic disrupted our plans, and the late administration of the exam became a consequence of the challenging circumstances we faced during that year. So, the late finishes because of COVID-19 are now a unique part of our high school memories. These tough times taught us the value of being flexible and sticking together when things didn't go as planned.</p>
